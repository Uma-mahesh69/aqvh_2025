        "\n",
        "*   The dataset consists of transaction and identity information, merged successfully based on `TransactionID`, resulting in 590,540 rows and 434 columns.\n",
        "*   A significant portion of columns (those with >50% missing values) were dropped during preprocessing to handle missing data. Remaining missing values were imputed using the median for numerical columns and the mode for categorical columns, resulting in a dataframe with no missing values.\n",
        "*   Categorical features were successfully encoded using Label Encoding, converting 'object' type columns to numerical types.\n",
        "*   Numerical features (excluding 'TransactionID' and 'isFraud') were scaled using `MinMaxScaler`.\n",
        "*   Feature selection was performed using PCA, reducing the dimensionality to 3 principal components to align with potential qubit limitations for quantum processing.\n",
        "*   The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using stratification to preserve the fraud ratio. A smaller stratified subset of the training data (5000 samples) was created for demonstration.\n",
        "*   Class imbalance in the training subset was addressed using `RandomOverSampler`, increasing the number of samples.\n",
        "*   A classical Logistic Regression model was trained on the resampled training subset and evaluated on the test set, achieving a ROC-AUC of 0.7250, an accuracy of 0.7180, a precision of 0.0747, and a recall of 0.6196 for the fraud class.\n",
        "*   Attempts to set up and train a Qiskit Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) failed repeatedly due to persistent `ImportError` issues with the `COBYLA` optimizer across multiple attempted import paths (`qiskit.algorithms.optimizers`, `qiskit.optimize`, `qiskit.utils.algorithm_globals`).\n",
        "*   Consequently, the VQC could not be trained or evaluated, making a direct performance comparison between the classical and quantum models impossible within this process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The primary bottleneck was the inability to import the required Qiskit optimizer. Resolving this library compatibility issue is the critical next step to enable VQC training and proceed with the hybrid quantum-classical pipeline.\n",
        "*   Once the VQC training is functional, future steps should include hyperparameter tuning for both the classical and VQC models, exploring different feature selection methods (potentially involving more features if qubit limits allow), and potentially experimenting with different Qiskit feature maps and ansatz circuits to optimize VQC performance.\n"
